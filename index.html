<h2>This is my awesome work</h2>
 <p>Here are my class:</p>

<h3>Writing Short Fiction</h3>
		<p>Every class, we read a story and dissect the overacrching themes, motifs, and purposes of the work.

<h3>Comm Research</h3>
		<p>This class teaches the different techniques and styles of media research. Eventually, we will produce our own research questions and test them using one of the techniques.

<h3>Writing and Digital Media</h3>
	<p>In this class, I am learning the basics of HTML coding. Hopefully, I will be able to code a website from scratch by then end of the semester.

<h3>Media and Society</h3>
	<p>This class teaches the history of media mediums and how each has affected and produced the society we live in today.
